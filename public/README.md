# The Beach Frontend

This directory contains the frontend for The Beach, a collection of demos and tools for working with Lit Protocol and other decentralized technologies.

## Features

### Multi-Game-Manager Architecture

### Geospatial Game Manager

The Geospatial Game Manager is responsible for executing geospatial tasks, including tools for working with maps, location data, and geographic information systems.

### VR Game Manager

The VR Game Manager is responsible for executing VR tasks, including tools for working with 3D models, virtual environments, and user interactions.

### VoIP Game Manager

The VoIP Game Manager is responsible for executing VoIP tasks, including tools for working with audio streams, real-time communication, and voice recognition.

### IoT Game Manager

The IoT Game Manager is responsible for executing IoT tasks, including tools for working with sensors, devices, and data streams.
