## Pricing Structure

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based, Not Cost-Based**

We don't price based on our costs (which are minimal). We price based on the **value we deliver to clients**.

**Calculation Framework:**

**Client's Current Cost:**
```
6 Senior Developers × $150,000/year = $900,000
+ Benefits (30%) = $270,000
+ Office & Equipment = $60,000
+ Management Overhead = $120,000
────────────────────────────────────
Total Annual Cost = $1,350,000
```

**Our Pricing:**
```
NPE Team Enterprise = $75,000/month × 12 = $900,000/year
────────────────────────────────────
Client Savings = $450,000/year (33%)
```

**But wait, there's more value:**
- 24/7 operation = 3x more capacity
- Zero turnover = $0 recruiting costs
- Instant scaling = faster time-to-market
- Consistent quality = fewer production bugs

**True ROI: 300-500%**

---

### Pricing Comparison

| Solution | Annual Cost | Capacity | Quality | Scalability |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **6 In-House Devs** | $1,350,000 | 40 hrs/week | Variable | Slow (3-6 months) |
| **Outsourced Team** | $720,000 | 40 hrs/week | Variable | Medium (1-2 months) |
| **Freelancers** | $600,000 | Part-time | Very Variable | Fast (days) |
| **NPE Team Enterprise** | $900,000 | 24/7 (168 hrs/week) | Consistent | Instant |

**NPE delivers 4.2x more capacity at comparable cost = 76% lower cost per hour**
