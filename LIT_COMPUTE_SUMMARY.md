# 🚀 Project Summary: Lit Compute Network

**Branch:** `product/lit-compute-network`  
**Status:** ✅ Design Complete - Ready for Development  
**Created:** November 5, 2025

---

## 🎯 What We Built

A **distributed CPU processing network** that allows users to:
1. **Share CPU power** to process Lit Protocol encryption operations
2. **Earn cryptocurrency** for contributing compute resources
3. **Lower costs** for apps using encryption (The Beach, NPE agents, etc.)

---

## 💡 The Innovation

### Current Problem
- Apps need expensive servers to handle cryptographic operations
- The Beach with 10M NPE agents = $10M/year in compute costs
- Centralized = single point of failure + privacy concerns

### Our Solution
- **Distributed network** of 10,000+ home computers
- Users earn $5-$240/day sharing CPU
- Apps pay only for compute used
- **Privacy-preserving** - nodes never see plaintext data

## 💰 Business Model

### Revenue Streams (Year 5)

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Platform fees (10% of jobs) | $360M/year |
| API subscriptions | $12M/year |

## 🤝 Integration with The Beach

### Before Lit Compute Network
```
The Beach → AWS Servers ($10M/year) → Lit Protocol
```

### After Lit Compute Network
```
The Beach → Distributed Nodes ($1M/year) → Lit Protocol
           ↓
    Saves $9M/year ✅
```

### NPE Agent Benefits
- 90% lower compute costs
- 10x faster operations (parallel processing)
- Better privacy (distributed vs centralized)
- Geographic distribution (lower latency)
