### 🎨 Creating New Scenes with AI

One of the most exciting ways to extend The Beach is by creating new scenes! Here's how to use AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot to generate new environments:

#### Step 1: Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-beach.git
cd the-beach
git checkout -b feature/new-scene-underwater-cave
```

#### Step 2: Use AI to Generate Scene Code

Ask an AI assistant to help you create a new Babylon.js scene. Here's an example prompt:

```
I'm working on a Babylon.js WebXR project. I need to create an underwater cave scene 
with the following features:
- Bioluminescent plants on cave walls
- Schools of fish swimming around
- Underwater lighting effects with caustics
- Collision detection for cave walls
- Teleportation points using glowing crystals
- Ambient underwater sound effects

Please provide the JavaScript/TypeScript code for creating this scene in Babylon.js,
following the structure in this example: [paste relevant code from xr-scene.js]
```

#### Step 3: Integrate the AI-Generated Scene

1. Create a new scene file in `public/js/`:
   ```bash
   touch public/js/underwater-cave-scene.js
   ```

2. Paste and adapt the AI-generated code, making sure to:
   - Follow the existing code structure and patterns
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add proper error handling
   - Include collision detection
   - Add WebXR teleportation support

3. Create a new HTML page or route for your scene:
   ```bash
   cp public/index.html public/underwater-cave.html
   ```
   
   Update the script reference to load your new scene file.

4. Add a controller route in `src/xr/xr.controller.ts`:
   ```typescript
   @Get('underwater-cave')
   getUnderwaterCave(@Res() res: Response) {
     return res.sendFile(join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'underwater-cave.html'));
   }
   ```

#### Step 4: Test and Refine

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/xr/underwater-cave` and test your new scene. Iterate with the AI assistant to fix any issues or add enhancements.

#### Step 5: Document and Share

Add documentation for your new scene:
- Update the README with information about the new scene
- Add screenshots or videos
- Document any new controls or interactions
- Update the `/xr/info` endpoint to include your scene

### 💡 Ideas for New Scenes

Here are some scene ideas you can create with AI assistance:

- 🌲 **Forest Retreat** - Dense forest with wildlife and treehouse
- 🏔️ **Mountain Summit** - Snowy peak with aurora borealis
- 🌙 **Moonbase** - Sci-fi lunar station with Earth views
- 🏛️ **Ancient Temple** - Mysterious ruins with puzzles
- 🌊 **Underwater City** - Submerged Atlantis-style metropolis
- 🏜️ **Desert Oasis** - Sand dunes with palm tree oasis
- 🌌 **Space Station** - Zero-gravity orbital platform
- 🏰 **Medieval Castle** - Fantasy fortress with dragons

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript where possible
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Test in both VR and non-VR modes
